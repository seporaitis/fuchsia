# Magenta Kernel

This repository is an attempt to
apply
[6.828 Operating Systems](https://github.com/seporaitis/xv6-public/wiki) knowledge
in practice, by trying to understand where is what in Google Fuchsia's
Magenta kernel code.

The meat of this repository is in
the [Wiki](https://github.com/seporaitis/fuchsia-magenta/wiki). The
code repo will hold reference documentation files, if any.
