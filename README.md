# Google Fuchsia

This repository is an attempt to
apply
[6.828 Operating Systems](https://github.com/seporaitis/xv6-public/wiki) knowledge
in practice, by trying to understand what is where in Google Fuchsia's
Magenta kernel code.

This is not official (at all), nor very comprehensive (yet).

## Magenta Kernel

The "meat" of this documentation is in
the [Wiki](https://github.com/seporaitis/fuchsia/wiki). The
code repo will hold reference documentation files, if any.
